# Challenge 23: Diagnostic Management of Infection in Febrile Neutropenia Patients


The low positivity rates observed in certain microbiological diagnostic tests for febrile neutropenia highlight the need for cost-effective diagnostic management. Using a dataset of all our neutropenic patients with malignant hematologic disorders, generative AI could assist in developing a diagnostic protocol with prioritized and targeted diagnostic testing to maximize cost-efficiency in infection diagnosis, focusing tests based on the etiological suspicion of bacterial, viral, or fungal infections.
Population: Hematologic patients with febrile neutropenia
Involved Specialties: Infectious diseases, hematology, microbiology

The methodology employed to address this challenge could lead to more efficient use of diagnostic testing in various pathologies.


## Objective

To develop an AI model with a diagnostic protocol that prioritizes and limits diagnostic testing to achieve maximum cost-efficiency in infection diagnosis, based on the suspicion of bacterial, viral, or fungal infection, using a dataset of neutropenic patients with malignant hematologic conditions.

## Shared bucket
Participants have an available bucket to store all of the desired documents and use them to develop the challenge.


```
https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/shared-clinic-hackathon-2024?region=us-west-2&bucketType=general&tab=objects
```

Members of each group ONLY will have access to the folder with the name of their group. It is advised to check `demos DEMO_s3_read_file` and `DEMO_s3_write_file` to learn how to write and read a file from a bucket. Use the following values in the demos:


```python
BUCKET_NAME = 'shared-clinic-hackathon-2024' 
BUCKET_FILE_LOCATION_AND_NAME = '<nombre_del_grupo>/<nombre_del fichero>' 
# NOTA: 
# - remplazar <nombre_del_grupo> por el nombre del grupo al que usted pertenece  (por ejemplo, Team1) 
# - remplazar <nombre_del fichero> por el nombre del fichero que se desea leer/escribir.
``` 


## Results
The challenge will only be validated if the participants save ALL the needed files to replicate the proposed answer by the members of the group. This implies that if the group integrants needed to modify somo of the files that have been provided with, or they have used external info to solve the challenge, they must include it as a part of the answer.


The files must be stored in the buscket [results-clinic-hackathon-2024](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/results-clinic-hackathon-2024?region=us-west-2&bucketType=general&tab=objects). The files location inside the bucket must be: `<nombre_grupo>/<nombre_reto>/<ficheros_resultados>`. 


It is advised to use demo `DEMO_s3_write_file` to write the files/code of the proposed answer. Use the following values in the demos:


```python
BUCKET_NAME = 'results-clinic-hackathon-2024' 
BUCKET_FILE_LOCATION_AND_NAME = '<nombre_del_grupo>/<nombre_del reto>/<nombre_del fichero>' 
# NOTA: :
# - remplazar <nombre_del_grupo> por el nombre del grupo al que usted pertenece (por ejemplo, Team1)
# - remplazar <nombre_del reto> por el nombre del reto al que corresponde la soluci√≥n propuesta (por ejemplo, Challenge1)
# - remplazar <nombre_del fichero> por el nombre del fichero que se desea almacenar (por ejemplo, main_code_challenge1.ipynb)
``` 

## Annex

We have a comprehensive, refined dataset that includes all febrile neutropenia patients, with 4,520 microbiological tests conducted and their results (10% positivity rate), corresponding to 462 episodes of febrile neutropenia in patients with malignant hematologic conditions treated at the hospital from January 2020 to July 2022. This dataset serves as a solid foundation to develop an optimized diagnostic protocol with the support of generative artificial intelligence, prioritizing and limiting diagnostic tests to maximize cost-efficiency in infection detection, based on the etiological suspicion of bacterial, viral, or fungal infection.
