# Challenge 03: PAIN Education


This challenge focuses on integrating documents generated in the first challenge (Pain Clinical History) with a reference document (ACPA – Stanford Resource Guide To Chronic Pain Management) to create a chatbot that provides patient education on their condition. Education is a key aspect of chronic pain management, and this system will provide patients with personalized and relevant information.

## Objective

Create a chatbot that educates patients on their condition.

## Expected Outcomes
To be agreed with the mentor.

## Tools

Participants will have the following information/tools to complete the challenge.

- Database:
    - Information about the database.

- Develop:
    - Jupyter Notebook
    - Bedrock
    - Shared bucket 

- Guides. It is recommended to consult the following demos:
    - DEMO_bedrock_connection
    - DEMO_RAG_with_KnowledgeBase
    - DEMO_RAG_with_Kendra
    - DEMO_download_studies_and_upload_to_s3
    - DEMO_s3_read_file
    - DEMO_s3_write_file

**All development must be carried out using the services available on AWS. Moving information outside of the specified tools is NOT allowed.**

Below are details of the most relevant aspects of the tools available to participants.

### Database

| id_patient_pseu      | Patient identification number that links the patients between tables       |

*NOTE: Check Dictionaries file for the description of the value

**NOTE:** If a patient is not found in the databases, the k-anonimization has deleted it.

C. Free text documents

The types of reports that we may encounter are:
| Name      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| INF_VAL_INI      | Starting validation report  |
| EVOL_ANCLD/ INF_EVO      | Evolution report |
| INF_AL_UR      | Emergency discharge report  |
| INF_AL      | Discharge report  |
| INF_AD      | Hospital admission report  |
| INF_TR      | Transport report  |
| TC_CR      | Cranial CT  |
| CUR_CLI      | Clinical course  |
| INF_END      | Endoscopy report  |
| IR_PSI_CLIN      | Neuropsychologycal report, psychometry  |
| IR_PSI_TEC      | TEC reports  |

In the free-text reports the file name is always structured as follows:

{challenge_number} _{challenge_identifier_number} _{report_type} _{id_patient_pseu} _{creation_date} _{counter}.txt

For example:
01_02_INF_VAL_INI_407789453_20211119_29.txt
-	Challenge: 01
-	Challenge identifier number: 02
-	Report type: INF_VAL_INI
-	Id_patient_pseu: 407789453
-	Creation date (YYYYMMDD): 20211119
-	Counter: 29


### Shared bucket

Participants have access to a shared bucket to store any necessary documents for the challenge.

```
https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/shared-clinic-hackathon-2024?region=us-west-2&bucketType=general&tab=objects
```

Each group has access ONLY to the folder named after their group. It is recommended to check the demos `DEMO_s3_read_file` and `DEMO_s3_write_file` to learn how to read and write files from a bucket. Use the following values in the demos:

```python
BUCKET_NAME = 'shared-clinic-hackathon-2024'
BUCKET_FILE_LOCATION_AND_NAME = '<grupo_name>/<file_name>'
# NOTE:
# - replace <grupo_name> by the name of your team  (e.g. Team1)
# - replace <file_name> by the file name you want to read/write.
```

## Results

The challenge will only be considered valid if participants save ALL files necessary to reproduce the solution proposed by the group members. This implies that if the group members modified any provided files or used external information to solve the challenge, these must be included as part of the solution.

Files must be saved in the bucket: [results-clinic-hackathon-2024](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/results-clinic-hackathon-2024?region=us-west-2&bucketType=general&tab=objects). The file location within the bucket (prefixes) must be: `<group_name>/<challenge_name>/<file_name>`.

It is recommended to use the `DEMO_s3_write_file` demo to write the files/code of the proposed solution. Use the following values in the demos:

```python
BUCKET_NAME = 'results-clinic-hackathon-2024'
BUCKET_FILE_LOCATION_AND_NAME = '<group_name>/<challenge_name>/<file_name>'
# NOTA: :
# - replace <group_name> by the name of your team (e.g. Team1)
# - replace <challenge_name>  by the name of the challenge (e.g. Challenge1)
# - replace <file_name> by the name of the file that you want to store (e.g., main_code_challenge1.ipynb)
```
### Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the effectiveness of the educational system generated for the chatbot, the following metrics will be used: 
- precision and recall to measure reliability and the system’s ability to identify and provide all relevant information
- accuracy and F1-score to assess the overall precision and completeness of the information provided
- coherence and clarity to measure the fluency and comprehensibility of responses
- response speed to assess the chatbot's response time
- user satisfaction to gather feedback on the chatbot's utility and effectiveness
- content integrity to assess relevance, completeness, accuracy, and factuality of the content provided
- efficiency to measure the ease of system integration and response generation speed
- trustworthiness to consider ethical implications of the generated content
- and practical utility to evaluate the relevance and effectiveness of the content in real-world applications for patients.
