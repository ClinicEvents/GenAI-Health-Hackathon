# Challenge 01: Clinical History of Pain


This challenge focuses on using generative AI models to improve the collection and management of clinical histories during the initial visit and follow-up for patients in the pain unit. Currently, due to limited time for consultations, there is often not enough time to administer validated questionnaires or engage in in-depth discussions with patients. The integration of generative AI could enable more comprehensive and precise data collection, improving both the quality of the first visit and follow-up. It would also facilitate a more reliable and reproducible monitoring of outcomes and allow for the easy generation of documents for both the patient and their clinical history.

## Objective

Generate a report for the patient and other physicians based on previous clinical courses, imaging tests, and neurophysiological assessments. An initial assessment report or, in the case of follow-up visits, an updated clinical course will be generated for the patient, which will then be uploaded back into the SAP system for continued monitoring.


## Expected Outcomes

Pain medical history report must contain the following:

1. Demographic and Socioeconomic Data:
	- Age: Crucial, as age affects pain presentation and management (older adults, children, adolescents).
	- Sex: Influences prevalence and presentation. Record sex assigned at birth and gender.
	- Educational Level/Health Literacy: Impacts understanding of pain and treatment. Evaluate patientâ€™s ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.
	- Employment Status: Assess impact on work capacity and the need for accommodations. Record specific occupation.
	- Marital Status/Social Support: Influences support network. Detail family composition and available support.
	- Socioeconomic Level: Affects access to resources. Include information on income, insurance, and barriers to access.
	- Cultural Background/Beliefs about Pain: Influences pain perception and expression. Record ethnicity, religion, and specific beliefs regarding the cause and meaning of pain.

### Shared bucket

Participants have access to a shared bucket to store any necessary documents for the challenge.

```
https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/shared-clinic-hackathon-2024?region=us-west-2&bucketType=general&tab=objects
```

Each group has access ONLY to the folder named after their group. It is recommended to check the demos `DEMO_s3_read_file` and `DEMO_s3_write_file` to learn how to read and write files from a bucket. Use the following values in the demos:

```python
BUCKET_NAME = 'shared-clinic-hackathon-2024'
BUCKET_FILE_LOCATION_AND_NAME = '<grupo_name>/<file_name>'
# NOTE:
# - replace <grupo_name> by the name of your team  (e.g. Team1)
# - replace <file_name> by the file name you want to read/write.
```

## Results

The challenge will only be considered valid if participants save ALL files necessary to reproduce the solution proposed by the group members. This implies that if the group members modified any provided files or used external information to solve the challenge, these must be included as part of the solution.

Files must be saved in the bucket: [results-clinic-hackathon-2024](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/results-clinic-hackathon-2024?region=us-west-2&bucketType=general&tab=objects). The file location within the bucket (prefixes) must be: `<group_name>/<challenge_name>/<file_name>`.

It is recommended to use the `DEMO_s3_write_file` demo to write the files/code of the proposed solution. Use the following values in the demos:

```python
BUCKET_NAME = 'results-clinic-hackathon-2024'
BUCKET_FILE_LOCATION_AND_NAME = '<group_name>/<challenge_name>/<file_name>'
# NOTA: :
# - replace <group_name> by the name of your team (e.g. Team1)
# - replace <challenge_name>  by the name of the challenge (e.g. Challenge1)
# - replace <file_name> by the name of the file that you want to store (e.g., main_code_challenge1.ipynb)
```
